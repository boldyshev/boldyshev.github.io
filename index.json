We address the question what can be achieved with a simplified discrete model. The proposed model resembles artificial neural networks enriched with additional biologically inspired features. A neuron has several states, and the state transitions follow endogenous patterns which roughly correspond to firing behavior observed in biological neurons: oscillatory, tonic, plateauing, etc. Neural interactions consist of two components: synaptic connections and extrasynaptic emission of neurotransmitters. The dynamics is asynchronous and event-based; the events correspond to the changes in neurons activity. This model is innovative in introducing discrete framework for modeling neurotransmitter interactions which play the important role in neuromodulation. We simulate rhythmic activity of small neural ensembles like central pattern generators (CPG). The modeled examples include: the biphasic rhythm generated by the half-center mechanism with the post-inhibitory rebound (like the leech heartbeat CPG), the triphasic rhythm (like in pond snail feeding CPG) and the pattern switch in the system of several neurons (like the switch between ingestion and egestion in Aplysia feeding CPG). The asynchronous dynamics allows to obtain multi-phasic rhythms with phase durations close to their biological prototypes. The perspectives of discrete modeling in biological research are discussed in the conclusion.","tags":[],"title":"Simulating Small Neural Circuits with a Discrete Computational Model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hitoshi Aonuma","Maxim Mezheritskiy","Boris Boldyshev","Yuki Totani","Dmitry Vorontsov","Igor Zakharov","Etsuro Ito","Varvara Dyakonova"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Recently, immediate effects of intense locomotion on the decision-making under uncertainty were reported in the Great Pond snail, Lymnaea stagnalis (Korshunova et al., 2016). In this animal, serotonergic neurons control locomotion, and serotonin modulates many processes underlying behavior, including cognitive ones (memory and learning). Whether serotonin mediates the behavioral effects of intense locomotion in mollusks, as it does in vertebrates, remains unknown. Here, the delayed facilitating effects of intense locomotion on the decision-making in the novel environment are described in Lymnaea. Past exercise was found to alter the metabolism of serotonin, namely the content of serotonin precursor and its catabolites in the cerebral and pedal ganglia, as measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The immediate and delayed effects of exercise on serotonin metabolism were different. Moreover, serotonin metabolism was regulated differently in different ganglia. Pharmacological manipulations of the serotonin content and receptor availability suggests that serotonin is likely to be responsible for the locomotor acceleration in the test of decision-making under uncertainty performed after exercise. However, the exercise-induced facilitation of decision-making (manifested in a reduced number of turns during the orienting behavior) cannot be attributed to the effects of serotonin.","tags":[],"title":"The Role of Serotonin in the Influence of Intense Locomotion on the Behavior Under Uncertainty in the Mollusk Lymnaea stagnalis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Oleg Kuznetsov","Nikolay Bazenkov","Boris Boldyshev","Ludmila Zhilyakova","Sergey Kulivets","Ilya Chistopolsky"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

The model significantly extends the previous work [1, 2] by novel concepts that make it more biologically plausible. In the model, neurons interact by emitting neurotransmitters to the shared extracellular space (ECS). We introduce the dynamics of membrane potentials that comprises two factors: the endogenous rates of change depending on the neuron‚Äôs firing type and the exogenous rates of change depending on the concentrations of neurotransmitters that the neuron is sensitive to. The neuron‚Äôs firing type is determined by the individual composition of endogenous rates. We consider three basic firing types: oscillatory, tonic, and reactive. Each firing type is essential for modeling central pattern generators‚Äîneural ensembles that generate rhythmic activity in the absence of external stimuli. Differences in endogenous rates of different neurons lead to asynchronous neural interactions and significant variability of phase durations in the activity patterns present in simple neural systems. The algorithm computing the behavior of the proposed model is provided.","tags":[],"title":"An Asynchronous Discrete Model of Chemical Interactions in Simple Neuronal Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\n Features  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides   Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E   Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)   Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\n Fragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \n A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears   Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view    Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links    night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links   Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/media/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}   Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }   Questions?
